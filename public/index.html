        <h1 class="title">What is the Soil Profile?</h1>
        <p class="description">
            A soil profile is a vertical section of soil that shows different layers or horizons.
            Each layer has unique physical and chemical properties, influenced by climate,
            vegetation, and topography.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Layers of the Soil Profile</h2>
        <ul class="layers">
            <li><strong>O Horizon</strong>: Organic layer, rich in decomposed plant and animal matter.</li>
            <li><strong>A Horizon</strong>: Topsoil, a mix of organic material and minerals; most plant roots are found here.</li>
            <li><strong>E Horizon</strong>: Eluviation layer, where minerals and nutrients are leached out; often lighter in color.</li>
            <li><strong>B Horizon</strong>: Subsoil, where minerals leached from above accumulate; denser and less fertile.</li>
            <li><strong>C Horizon</strong>: Parent material, made of weathered rock; the source of the soil's minerals.</li>
        </ul>
