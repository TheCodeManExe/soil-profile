        <h1>What is the soil profile?</h1><br>
        Soil profile is the vertical section of soil that shows the different layers or horizons. Each layer has distinct physical and chemical properties, which can vary significantly depending on factors like climate, vegetation, and topography.
        <br><br>
        <h2>Layers of Soil Profile</h2>
        The 5 main layers of soil profile are:
            O Horizon: Organic layer, rich in decomposed plant and animal matter.
            <br>
            A Horizon: Topsoil, a mix of organic material and minerals, where most plant roots are found.
            <br>
            E Horizon: Eluviation layer, where minerals and nutrients are leached out, often lighter in color.
            <br>
            B Horizon: Subsoil, where minerals leached from above accumulate, often denser and less fertile.
            <br>
            C Horizon: Parent material, consisting of weathered rock and minerals, the source of soil's mineral content also referred to as Bedrock.
